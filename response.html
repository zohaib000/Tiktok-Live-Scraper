We want TikTok to be a place that encourages self-esteem, and does not promote negative social comparisons. We do not allow showing or promoting disordered eating or any dangerous weight loss behaviors. If you or someone you know is experiencing concerns about body image, food, or exercise, support is available. Tap on “Get info” to view resources.","series_delistNotifications_reason_GBV_body":"Violation reason: Sexual Exploitation and Gender-Based Violence. We are committed to providing a space that embraces gender equity, supports healthy relationships, and respects intimate privacy. We do not allow sexual exploitation or gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual acts, image-based sexual abuse, sextortion, physical abuse, and sexual harassment.","series_delistNotifications_reason_age_body":"Violation reason: Minimum Age Requirement. Users must be 13 years and older to have a TikTok account. We are deeply committed to ensuring that TikTok is a safe and positive experience for people under the age of 18. This starts by being old enough to use TikTok. If we learn someone is below the minimum age on TikTok, we will ban that account. Content created by anyone under 16 is ineligible for the For You feed and harder to find in search.","series_delistNotifications_reason_animalabuse_body":"Violation reason: Animal Abuse. We want our platform to be a place that respects animals and celebrates the ways that they enrich our lives across different cultures and regions. We do not allow animal abuse, cruelty, neglect, trade, or other forms of animal exploitation.","series_delistNotifications_reason_bullying_body":"Violation reason: Harrassment and Bullying. We welcome the respectful expression of different viewpoints but not toxicity or trolling. We do not allow language or behavior that harasses, humiliates, threatens, or doxxes anyone.

We recognize that online content related to violence can cause real-world harm. We do not allow any violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities that may harm people, animals, or property. If there is a specific, credible, and imminent threat to human life or serious physical injury, we report it to relevant law enforcement authorities.","series_delistNotifications_reason_dangerous_body":"Violation reason: Dangerous Activities and Challenges. Most activities or challenges are appropriate for everyone, but some carry a risk of significant injury. We do not allow showing or promoting dangerous activities and challenges. This includes dares, games, tricks, inappropriate use of dangerous tools, eating substances that are harmful to one’s health, or similar activities that may lead to significant physical harm.","series_delistNotifications_reason_drugs_body":"Violation reason: Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drugs.

We do not allow showing or promoting recreational drug use, or the trade of alcohol, tobacco products, and drugs.","series_delistNotifications_reason_elections_body":"Violation reason: Civic and Election Integrity. Elections are important moments of community conversation and promote the values of an open society. We do not allow misinformation about civic and electoral processes, regardless of intent.

We do not allow the trade of services that attempt to artificially increase engagement or deceive TikTok’s recommendation system.","series_delistNotifications_reason_gambling_body":"Violation reason: Gambling. Many people around the world find entertainment through games of chance.

We do not allow the promotion of gambling services.","series_delistNotifications_reason_graphiccontent_body":"Violation reason: Shocking and Graphic Content. Part of the joy of TikTok is coming across new and unexpected content. But the platform is not a place to intentionally shock, upset, or disgust others. We recognize this type of content may be triggering, cause psychological harm, or lead to extreme discomfort. We do not allow gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent.","series_delistNotifications_reason_hateorgs_body":"Violation reason: Violent and Hateful Organizations and Individuals. There is no place on our platform for beliefs or propaganda that encourage violence or hate. We do not allow the presence of violent and hateful organizations or individuals on our platform. Often the ideas of these actors are amplified by others. We do not allow anyone to promote or materially support violent or hateful actors.","series_delistNotifications_reason_hatespeech_body":"Violation reason: Hate Speech and Hateful Behaviors. TikTok is enriched by the various backgrounds of our community members. Our differences should be respected, rather than a cause for division. We do not allow any hateful behavior, hate speech, or promotion of hateful ideologies. This includes content that attacks a person or group because of protected attributes.","series_delistNotifications_reason_misinformation_body":"Violation reason: Misinformation. In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality. We do not allow inaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent. Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage.","series_delistNotifications_reason_nudity_body":"Violation reason: Nudity & Body Exposure.

We do not allow content that includes personal information that may create a risk of stalking, violence, phishing, fraud, identity theft, or financial exploitation, including content that someone has posted themselves or that they consented to being shared by others.","series_delistNotifications_reason_regulatedgoods_body":"Violation reason: Trade of Regulated Goods and Services. Regulated goods and services often play an important and essential role in people’s lives. However, these items are regulated for a reason. TikTok is not a place for illegal traffic or trade, or an unofficial market. We do not allow facilitating the trade of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services, such as alcohol, tobacco products, regulated substances, firearms and other dangerous weapons, sexual services, animals, or counterfeit goods.","series_delistNotifications_reason_scams_body":"Violation reason: Frauds and Scams.

Tap on “Get info” to view resources.","series_delistNotifications_reason_sexualactivity_body":"Violation reason: Sexual Activity and Services. TikTok is a place where people can come to discuss or learn about sexuality, sex or reproductive health.

We do not allow sexual activity or services, including sex, sexual arousal, fetish and kink behavior, and seeking or offering sexual services.","series_delistNotifications_reason_suggestivecontent_body":"Violation reason: Sexually Suggestive Content. We welcome performances and dances where people can creatively express themselves, celebrate their culture, or seek to entertain. We are mindful that certain behaviors related to sexual arousal or suggestiveness may be offensive to some people and may put young people at risk of exploitation. We do not allow seductive performances or allusions to sexual activity by young people, or the use of sexually explicit narratives by anyone.","series_delistNotifications_reason_synthmedia_body":"Violation reason: Synthetic and Manipulated Media. We welcome the creativity that new artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies may unlock. However, AI can make it more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. Synthetic or manipulated media that shows realistic scenes must be clearly disclosed. We do not allow synthetic media that contains the likeness of any real private figure, in addition to synthetic media of public figures if the content is used for endorsements or violates any other policy.","series_delistNotifications_reason_unoriginal_body":"Violation reason: Unoriginal Content and QR Codes. The creativity on TikTok is what makes it great, so you should only post your own work. Content is ineligible for the For You feed and harder to find in search if it involves unoriginal or reproduced content that does not have any new or creative changes, or contains Quick Response (QR) codes.","series_delistNotifications_reason_weapons_body":"Violation reason: Firearms and Dangerous Weapons. TikTok can be a place that educates people on the responsible use and ownership of weapons, as well as the associated potential for serious harm. Firearms and explosive weapons can cause severe injury or death, especially when used in an unsafe manner. We do not allow the trade of firearms or explosive weapons, or content showing or promoting them if they are not used in a safe or appropriate setting.","series_delistNotifications_reason_youthabuse_body":"Violation reason: Youth Exploitation and Abuse.
